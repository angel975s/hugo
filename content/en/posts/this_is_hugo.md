Hugo is a modern framework for general purpose website creation. It falls into the category of new static site generators, 2 based on the dynamic JAMstack architecture and is written entirely in Go. It was originally created by Steve France in 2013. And since 2015 it has seen a huge increase in features and performance, thanks to developer Bj√∏rn Erik Pedersen (as of v0.14), and other contributors.3 Hugo is a licensed open source project under the Apache 2.0.4 License
